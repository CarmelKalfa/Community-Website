Dear all,

I wanted to let you know that I have made the decision to publish and share the website I have built on my own using HTML and CSS programming languages. However, please note that the version I have published only includes the frontend and does not include any backend functionality.

If you have any questions or would like to suggest any additions to the website, please feel free to contact me via Discord.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
@CarmelKalfa
